# 🧠 SQL Subqueries & Nested Queries

## 🎯 Objective
Develop advanced SQL skills by mastering subqueries and nested logic within `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `FROM` clauses. You'll explore how to embed queries inside other queries to solve complex data retrieval problems.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **DB Browser for SQLite**
- **MySQL Workbench**

## 🧪 Task Description
Write SQL queries that make use of:
- **Scalar subqueries**: Return a single value
- **Correlated subqueries**: Depend on the outer query for values
- **Nested subqueries**: Used within `SELECT`, `IN`, `EXISTS`, and `=` conditions

### 📌 Hints / Mini Guide
1. Create meaningful datasets such as:
   - `Smartphones`: phone details (`brand_name`, `model`, `price`, `camera`)
   - `Sales`: transactions (`model`, `units_sold`, `region`)
2. Use subqueries to:
   - Find phones priced above the average using `SELECT`
   - Identify phones sold in specific regions using `IN`
   - Filter phones with existing sales records using `EXISTS`

## 📂 Deliverables
This repository includes:
- ✅ SQL scripts using subqueries in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `FROM`
- ✅ Examples of scalar and correlated subqueries
- ✅ Realistic dataset for hands-on practice
- ✅ Comments to guide understanding and usage of each query

## 📘 Learning Outcome
By completing this task, you'll gain:
- Strong command over nested queries and logical layering
- Confidence in writing both simple and advanced subqueries
- The ability to solve real-world problems with compact SQL syntax

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Load the sample data in your preferred SQL tool.
3. Execute each script and explore the output.
4. Modify queries to deepen your understanding and test new logic.
